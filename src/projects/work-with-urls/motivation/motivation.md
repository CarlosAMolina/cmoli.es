## Motivation

I worked at a cybersecurity team for some years analyzing URLs to find phishing sites. As we had to open lots of URLs, we used websites that open in new tabs a given list of URLs. But open the URL was the first analysis step, all the path’s parts must be checked too! In order to find phishing redirections, shells… I thought an extension with this characteristics would facilitate our work.

Another typical task was to obfuscate malicious URLs to share them with our coworkers or clients without worried about being opened unintentionally. In the same way, we had to deobfuscate the received URLs to analyze. New add-on’s options to add!

Thanks to the users’ feedback, more options were added, like configure a delay between each open tab.

I think this is an useful add-on for all the people who analyze URLs and I hope you enjoy it!
